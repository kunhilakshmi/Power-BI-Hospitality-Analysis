##### Domain: Hospitality  
##### Function: Revenue

## Project Overview:
AtliQ Grands is a renowned chain of luxury five-star hotels in India, leading the hospitality industry for over two decades. Their dedication to exceptional guest experiences has established them as a preferred choice for upscale accommodations.
Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.

## Things I've learned from this project :

- I've got the hospitality domain knowledge ,and yeah having domain knowledge is really important and that will be helpful to full fill the requirements of stakeholders.

- And I've got to know few important key metrics which plays an important role in hotel revenue performance like 
  - Revenue per available room (RevPar)
  - Average Daily Rate (ADR)
  - Occupancy %
  - Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
  - Realisation %
 
- In order to create these KPI's ,I've learnt the effective usage of DAX.
- Understanding the  requirements of business based on the data and learnt how to ask right questions to stakeholders in order to prepare an effective dashboard.
- And proper usage of color palettes for creating dashboards.

## Insights
-  **ADR Stability:** The Average Daily Rate (ADR) has remained steady, indicating a consistent pricing strategy. However, there's an opportunity to implement dynamic pricing based on weekdays and weekends to optimize revenue by aligning rates with demand fluctuations.
- **Occupancy Rate:** AtliQ Grands' properties have a healthy occupancy rate of 57%, indicating effective room utilization. Strategies to further increase occupancy, especially during off-peak periods, could enhance revenue potential.
- **Average Rating:** Guest satisfaction, reflected in an average rating of 3.62, highlights the positive guest experience provided by AtliQ Grands. Maintaining and improving this rating through exceptional service and addressing guest feedback is crucial for continued success.
